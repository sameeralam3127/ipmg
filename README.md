**IPMG (IP Management Tool)** is a modern, modular, enterprise-ready network scanner and monitoring utility.
It replaces the legacy `ip_pinger.py` script with a **clean package architecture**, CLI tooling, and automated workflows.

Designed for:

- Network administrators
- Systems engineers
- Cybersecurity teams
- DevOps and SREs

IPMG supports:

- **Subnet auto-discovery**
- **Parallel pinging with thread pools**
- **Hostname resolution**
- **Multi-format reporting (XLSX/CSV/JSON)**
- **Scheduled recurrent scans**
- **Auto-generated sample Excel input**
- **Colorized CLI output**
- **Modular testable architecture**

## ⚠️ Security Disclaimer

> **Do NOT use this tool on networks without explicit authorization.**
> Always obtain written approval from your organization's **Cybersecurity / Network Security team**.
> Unauthorized scanning may violate internal policies or law.

IPMG includes a built-in disclaimer shown at runtime (`security.py`).

# Features

### ✔ Modular Python package (`src/ipmg`)

Not a single script anymore — now a clean, testable package.

### ✔ CLI Command: `ipmg`

Installed system-wide or via uv.

### ✔ Auto Subnet Discovery

Scan your `/24` instantly:

```
ipmg --discover
```

### ✔ Multi-threaded high performance

Scans hundreds of hosts in seconds.

### ✔ Auto Sample Excel Generation

If the input file is missing:

```
ip_list.xlsx
```

is created automatically.

### ✔ Supports multiple output formats

```
--formats xlsx csv json
```

### ✔ Hostname resolution

```
--resolve
```

### ✔ Scheduled scanning

```
--interval 5
```

Runs every 5 minutes.

### ✔ Fully tested (pytest) + formatted (ruff/black)

# Installation

## Option 1 — Install via uv (recommended)

```
uv tool install git+https://github.com/sameeralam3127/ipmg.git
```

Test:

```
ipmg --help
```

---

## Option 2 — Install via pip (editable, dev mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sameeralam3127/ipmg.git
cd IP_Management

pip install -e .
```

Now:

```
ipmg --help
```

---

## Option 3 — Install using curl installer

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sameeralam3127/ipmg/main/install.sh | bash
```

This script:

- Installs uv if missing
- Installs ipmg globally into uv

---

# Usage

### Help

```
ipmg --help
```

---

## Basic Example (using default input)

```
ipmg
```

If `ip_list.xlsx` does not exist → it will be created with sample IPs.

---

## Scan a custom input file

```
ipmg --input network_devices.xlsx
```

---

## Auto-discover LAN subnet

```
ipmg --discover
```

---

## Export results to CSV + XLSX

```
ipmg --formats csv xlsx
```

---

## Resolve hostnames (PTR)

```
ipmg --resolve
```

---

## Run every 10 minutes

```
ipmg --interval 10
```

# Troubleshooting

### **Command not found: ipmg**

Solution:

```
pip install -e .
```

### **Permission denied output folder**

Run inside a writeable directory or use:

```
sudo ipmg ...
```

### **Hostname Unresolvable**

Likely missing DNS PTR records.
